### Chaos Monkey

The goal of the project is to test the Replay protocol.

Here are some steps that we will do for every recording:

- [x] get all the recording JS
- [x] get all the breakable locations
- [ ] adding logpoints at random locations
- [ ] seeking to logpoints randomly
- [ ] step randomly through the code
- [ ] expand objects (aka load properties) randomly
- [ ] scriptable by other things (the test inbox)
